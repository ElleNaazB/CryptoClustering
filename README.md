## Project Overview

<a href ="https://github.com/ElleNaazB/CryptoClustering/blob/main/CryptoClustering/Crypto_Clustering.ipynb.ipynb">This project</a> demonstrates the use of machine learning and principal component analysis (PCA) for data analysis in the <a href = "https://github.com/ElleNaazB/CryptoClustering/blob/main/CryptoClustering/Resources/crypto_market_data.csv">cryptocurrency domain</a>. The process involved normalizing data with the StandardScaler() module, determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, and clustering cryptocurrencies with the K-means algorithm. Both the original scaled data and a PCA-reduced dataset were utilized to explore different clustering dynamics. Visualizations were created using hvPlot to identify patterns and assess the clustering effectiveness. This approach not only highlights the clustering of cryptocurrencies but also examines the impact of feature reduction on the clustering results.
